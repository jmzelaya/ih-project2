        <h3>Nail Polish Marbled Mugs</h3>
        <p>We all love craft projects that are way easier, quicker, and cheaper than they look, am I right? Take, for instance, this set of uber-classy marbled mugs that look like something you'd pick up at a museum gift shop. Even more amazing -- these beauties pretty much make themselves. I'm not even kidding. All it takes is some warm water, plain ceramic mugs (or teacups), some nail polish and a few spare minutes to create a gorgeous, one-of-a-kind set you'll be proud to own.</p>
